# Scopes

* Before introduce ES6 JavaScript standart we only had var for defining variables.
* By default JavaScript have a function based scope.
* By introducing *const* and *let* JavaScript also added a block based scope.

Scope is defined by using one of keywoards:
* var - function scope variable. Can be global if defined outside function.
* let - block scope variable. Can be reassigned.
* const - block scope read only variable. Cannot be reassigned.
* without keyword - makes variable global, reachable everywhere (not recommended).
```

Before we can understand a block or function based scope we need to understand what function is.
