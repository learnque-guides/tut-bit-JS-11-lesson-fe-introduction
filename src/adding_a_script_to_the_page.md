# Adding a script to the page

* To execute JS code, you can simply put it in `<script>` tag in your HTML.
* Just like with CSS, it is considered cleaner to create separate .js files to contain the code. To do that just add an attribute to script tag like so:

```html
<script>
    alert("Hello from JS :)");
</script>
```

```html
<script src="main.js"></script>
```
