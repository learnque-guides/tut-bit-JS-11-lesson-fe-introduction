# Variables

* JS features a dynamic typing. That means that all variables can be declared without specifying their type!
* Variables are declared using keywords *var*, *const*, *let*.

```js
var a = 5;
const b = "Test";
let c = 12.5;
```

The main differences:
* Between *var* and *let* (*const* as well) is a scope visibility;
* Between *let* and *const* is a mutability;
